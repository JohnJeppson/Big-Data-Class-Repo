Who am I?

I am the collection of memories and mental patterns that are in my brain.  

I remember going to BYU for a undergraduate degree in Microbiology and a minor in Music.

I also remember lots of other things, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I am here in this class because I think it is interesting.  Programing andbig data have been things I have been meaning to do in my personal time, but I haven't overcome the inertia needed to start and keep going.  

Taking a class is the impetus I need to start.  

With my life, I'd like to be involved in research that helps people and the world in some way.  I'm sure that I'll be able to convince myself that whatever I end up doing fufills that because people are capable of all sorts of self delusion.  Hopefully it will be true.

I hope to get out of this class, a base of knowing how to program, and use programming to work on databases, and big data analytics.  I'm fairly certain that is a very attainable goal.

I think that these are things that will be useful for me to know personally in my carrer, but that will also make me look better on paper as a prospective employee.
